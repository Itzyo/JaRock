		 as documented at https://wiki.vg/Mojang_API#UUID_-.3E_Profile_.2B_Skin.2FCape.
		 An empty properties array is also acceptable, and will cause clients to display the player with one of the two default skins depending on UUID.

			Ping values correspond with icons in the following way:
			
			A ping that negative (i.e. not known to the server yet) will result in the no connection icon.
			A ping under 150 milliseconds will result in 5 bars
			A ping under 300 milliseconds will result in 4 bars
			A ping under 600 milliseconds will result in 3 bars
			A ping under 1000 milliseconds (1 second) will result in 2 bars
			A ping greater than or equal to 1 second will result in 1 bar. -->
